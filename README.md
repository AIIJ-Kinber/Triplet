This README.md is designed to give your repository a professional, "open-source" feel while providing clear instructions for anyone (including your developer) who clones the code.

🚀 Triplet
Triplet is a high-performance AI aggregator designed to provide simultaneous, concise insights from the world's leading Large Language Models: GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 1.5 Flash.

Rather than switching between tabs, Triplet brings the best of AI into a single, stacked view, complete with an automated synthesis engine called "The Verdict."

✨ Key Features
Parallel Processing: All three models are triggered at once to minimize latency.

The Verdict: An automated "Judge" (GPT-4o) analyzes the responses to find consensus and unique perspectives.

Concise Mode: Hardcoded system prompts ensure answers are brief and to the point.

Visual Branded States: Real-time loading indicators color-coded by model (White for ChatGPT, Orange for Claude, Blue for Gemini).

Stacked UI: A horizontal row layout optimized for quick comparison.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: Next.js (React) + Tailwind CSS

Backend: FastAPI (Python)

Deployment: Vercel (Serverless Functions)

APIs: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Generative AI
